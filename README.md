# Brew_Stash
BrewStash is an Xamarin food application mainly targeted for the public use. The man idea for this application was to provide a portal for the users where they can select the coffee from the list. After selecting the coffee the user can make a payment and have the coffee on the go(on the user's defined time for the pickup).
